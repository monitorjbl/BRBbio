      <dd>BRBBio is a webapp designed to make easier for scientists to rapidly analyze their data. Instead of spending hours or days slaving over a hot Excel workbook, you can simply upload your
        raw data and cell viability and almost immediately extract your normalized data, Z-factors, and cytotoxicity!</dd>

        <p>
          First, you need to upload your raw data. To do that, it needs to be a particular format, and there are Excel templates provided below. Once you get your data in the proper format, go to the
          <a href="#/rawUpload">Raw Data Upload page</a>. Select the identifiers that are used as controls, give your experiment run a name, and upload your Excel file. If you have additional
          cytotoxicity data to go along with this experiment, upload it on the <a href="#/linkedUpload">Linked Cell Viability Upload page</a> and controls from your run will be prefilled. Or, if you
          have an independent set of viability data, you can use the <a href="#/independentUpload">Linked Viability Upload page</a> where you can select your own controls.
        </p>

        <p style="margin-top: 12px;">
          Congratulations, your data is now ready for analysis! You can normalize your data according to your own formula. Use the <a href="#/viewNormalizedData">Normalization page</a> to select your
          data set and enter a formula by which to normalize it. Once you have done so, you can download your dataset in Excel or TSV format or view directly on the screen. Similarly, you can go to
          the <a href="#/viewZFactors">Screen Quality Analysis page</a> or the <a href="#/viewViability">Cell Viability page</a>, define your own formula, and grab your data in the format of your
          choosing.
